# Studio Setup

Two questions, two scripts. *What can I use right now* is the bundled `scripts/doctor.py`. *How do I get the rest* is `video-studio setup`. Answer both against the machine in front of you — describing an installed tool as missing wastes the user's time and makes everything else you say suspect.

## Requires

`scripts/doctor.py` **ships with this skill** — stdlib-only, so the status report works the moment the skill is installed. It reads keys from `.env` in the current project, then `~/.config/video-studio/.env`, then the shell.

`setup.py` does not ship here: it installs into the engine's own composer directory, so it is not a lone file. It needs `pip install 'video-studio-engine @ https://github.com/scrollmark/social-skills/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz'` and runs as `video-studio setup`. **Without that install there is no install plan and no auto/system/manual classification** — you keep doctor's report of what is reachable, but you lose the one thing that stops an agent from running a package-manager install nobody asked for, and you are back to fixing gaps by hand. `references/tooling-inventory.md` in this skill is the map; only doctor knows the state.

## Checking an Environment

    python3 scripts/doctor.py           # what is reachable right now
    python3 scripts/doctor.py --json    # same, machine-readable

Doctor reports per category — public-domain archives, stock, generated video, generated images, generated audio, voice — plus the required binaries. It checks that a key is *present*, not that it works; a key can still be rejected at call time for spent quota or a withdrawn model, and the individual scripts report that.

To teach the workflow rather than describe it, `video-studio tutor --list` names the shipped tutorials; `--step <name> <n>` serves ONE step, and that is the design. A tutorial pasted whole is a document, not a lesson — nobody reads the middle and you cannot tell what landed. Serve a step, let them try it, ask whether it worked, then move. `--show` is for you to plan with, never to paste. Start with `getting-started`; it says up front which steps need a composer this repo does not ship.

Run it **before** offering sourcing options. Offering a source that turns out to have no key makes the estimate wrong as well as the offer.

## Fixing a Broken One

    video-studio setup                  # report + the exact plan, changes NOTHING
    video-studio setup --yes            # actually run the runnable fixes
    video-studio setup --yes --only composer,voice

Every missing component is classified, and the split is the whole point:

- **auto** — scoped to the toolchain directory, idempotent, safe to re-run: installing the composer's npm packages, warming the local voice model, copying `.env.example` to `.env`.
- **system** — changes the machine outside that directory, such as a package manager installing `ffmpeg` or `node`. Still runnable, but it is somebody's computer.
- **manual** — a human has to act: get an API key, enable billing, accept terms, restart a sandboxed host with network access. Never runnable. Printing "run this command" for something a machine cannot do erodes trust in the rest of the output.

**Ask first, every time, even for the safe ones.** Nothing runs without `--yes`, and `--yes` also runs the system-level installs. Tell the user what is missing in their terms ("the renderer isn't installed"), say whether you can fix it, then ask.

If everything is present, say nothing and get on with the work. Narrating a clean bill of health is noise.

## The Tier-0 Floor

Three things, and without any one of them nothing works: `ffmpeg` + `ffprobe` (every duration measured, every trim, all loudness and keying), `node` 18+ (the composer renders and previews through it), and `uv` (runs every bundled script with its own pinned dependencies). Everything else widens what you can reach; these three decide whether there is a pipeline at all.

After that, the single highest-value addition is a free Pexels key. It converts "find me footage of that" from a coin flip into the normal answer, and costs nothing. Full inventory, tiers, costs and rights in `references/tooling-inventory.md`.

## Licences

Every external service this skill can reach, with its cost and what you may do
with the output, is in `SERVICES.md` next to this file. Check it before anything
gets published. The music row is the one that actually bites: the free backend's
redistribution rights are unclear, the paid one is licensed catalogue.

## showwatcher Is Not Available, And Step 8 No Longer Waits For It

`showwatcher` is an internal analyzer that is **not published anywhere** — no
package, no repository you can install from. `video-studio setup` lists it with no
install command and `doctor.py` reports it missing, which is accurate; treat any
instruction to "install it from its own repo" as stale.

Step 8 does not depend on it. The `video-production` skill ships a `qc_render`
script of its own, which checks a render against the `plan.json` `build_props` wrote for it —
duration, the plan's own consistency, a black tail, a frozen ending, resolution
and fps. Pure stdlib over `ffmpeg`/`ffprobe`, so it needs no install at all.

What no bundled script can do is judge the picture: blur, caption overlap,
off-palette colour and clipped text need decoded frames and models. So the gate is
still two moves — run that script, then pull frames and **look at them, and say
out loud that you did**. A hand check silently skipped is worse than no gate.

## Anti-patterns

- **Quoting the docs instead of the machine.** The inventory is the map, not the state. Run doctor before saying a tool is available.
- **Installing without asking.** `--yes` touches the whole system. It is their computer, every time.
- **Dressing up a manual step as a command.** Nobody can `brew install` an API key or a billing account. Hand over the specific link.
- **Treating a present key as a working key.** Presence is all doctor can see. Quota, billing and withdrawn models fail at call time.
- **Assuming the sandbox has network.** Every stock lookup and generation call needs it; a host launched without it produces timeouts that look like provider outages.
