# TitledVideo — clip + typography package

An existing (or generated) clip dressed with title/end cards and section
labels — the "make this clip postable" format.

## Composition
Match source clip's orientation (probe with `measure`, bundled in `audio-acquisition`). Layers:
`main` clip full-frame; title card scene first (2-3s, text on color or
frame-grab background); optional corner section labels; end card with CTA.

## Interview
Round 1 — header "Source": The clip: supply file / URL / generate?
Round 2 — header "Text": Exact title, section labels (if any), end-card CTA
text. (Exact text — it renders as real typography.)
Round 3 — header "Style": Color accent + font vibe (clean/bold/playful)?
Round A — header "Audio": Score (supply a file / generate / none)?
Voice (built-in / supplied recording / none)? If generating the score, say
which backend and its rights terms before they choose, not after.
Round L — header "Look": Which caption/card preset — `video-studio styles --list`?
Any look they describe should be saved with `video-studio styles --save`.
Freeform: platform, whether captions are wanted over the clip.

## Slots
`main` clip, `title`, optional `labels[]` with timestamps, `cta`.

## Grammar
Title card ≤6 words. Labels appear at content transitions (probe the clip's
scene cuts if unsure — the quality check's scene detection can list them). End
card holds 3s minimum.

## Render notes

If the source is a still (or a very short clip held long), give it a `ken`
drift so it reads as footage rather than a frozen frame.
This format is pure composition — usually zero generation cost. Good first
demo of the studio preview loop.
