"""Measure media durations, dimensions, and a track's energy structure.

Usage:
  uv run scripts/measure.py FILE [FILE...]     durations + dimensions
  uv run scripts/measure.py --music TRACK      where the music actually changes

The measured narration duration IS the scene clock — plans estimate,
measurements decide (see references/voice-landmines.md, "Clocks").

--music exists because "cut to the music" is otherwise guesswork. It reports a
per-second loudness profile and, more usefully, the transitions: the points
where a window jumps or drops at least 3 dB against the trailing three seconds.
Those are the drops, breakdowns and lifts, and they are the only defensible
places to change section.

Two things it prevents, both observed:

  Cutting on a grid. Sections placed every N seconds drift out of phase with
  the track within about twenty seconds and read as arbitrary.

  Ending mid-phrase. A fade placed in the quiet bar BEFORE a final chorus
  sounds like the video was cut off, because it was. `end` reports where the
  track actually resolves, which is where the video should stop.
