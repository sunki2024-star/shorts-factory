# Voice and music landmines

Failure modes recorded from production. All of them succeed loudly and fail
quietly.

## The local voice (Kokoro)

- **Empty text raises "returned no audio".** For a deliberate quiet beat, ask
  for measured silence instead — it writes real silence, so downstream audio
  concatenation clocks stay aligned. A skipped file does not.
- **Trailing punctuation is stamped at the NEXT word's start.** It arrives as
  its own token, so unless punctuation-only tokens are merged onto the
  preceding word, every caption page opens with a stray mark.
- **Word timings exist only at synthesis time.** A resumed or cached WAV has
  none. If you need timings for a file you did not just synthesise, fall back
  to ASR or proportional estimation — and know that you have downgraded.
- **Short interjection lines garble.** "Mhm." breaks both synthesis and the
  downstream ASR check. Keep spoken lines to at least three real words.
- Delivery is flat by design. That is a reason to buy a voice for a brand film,
  not a reason to abandon it for a captioned format that needs the timings.

## The paid voice

- **No word timings at all.** Duration is measured off the returned file. A
  captioned format still needs the local voice.
- **Billed per character.** Check the account's own rate before a long batch;
  a 90-second script is roughly 1,100 characters.
- Caches on text + voice + settings exactly like the local one, so revisions
  over unchanged scenes are free.

## Music generators

- **Duration is a prompt hint for most of them.** One returned ~115 seconds for
  a 35-second request. Only the licensed-catalogue provider accepts a real
  length parameter. Always measure what came back.
- **A required field that reads as optional:** at least one provider requires a
  lyrics field even for an instrumental, and omitting it returns a generic
  "invalid params" error that names nothing. Pass an explicit instrumental
  marker.
- **A free tier whose quota is zero.** The resulting 429 is indistinguishable
  from rate limiting and never clears, because there is no allowance to reset.
  It is a billing gate.
- **Generated music can arrive peaking at 0 dBFS**, leaving no headroom. This
  is why normalising after render is real work rather than cosmetics.

## Clocks — the systemic bug class

- A scene's duration is the **measured** narration WAV, never the planned
  number. Building on planned durations desyncs audio, video and captions
  cumulatively, and the drift grows scene by scene: 20-30 findings per video
  before that rule, 0-6 after. `measure.py` exists so the measurement is
  available before anything is built on a guess.

## The composer's mix

- Music plays at a **fixed volume until you duck it.** The composer sets balance
  once, not per phrase, so a bed that competes with a loud line competes with it
  for the whole video. `video-studio duck_music --project <dir>` fixes that after
  `build_props`: it reads the narration WAVs, measures one RMS reading per frame,
  and writes a per-frame volume envelope into the props so the bed drops under
  speech and returns in the gaps. Run it after build_props and before rendering —
  build_props owns the clock, so re-running it overwrites the envelope.
- **Check the composer actually reads it.** `duck_music` writes `music.envelope`
  into the props and prints a successful summary whether or not anything consumes
  it. A composer that ignores that key plays the bed flat and reports nothing
  wrong. So if ducking looks like it ran and the render still competes with the
  narration, the envelope is being written and dropped: confirm the renderer
  reads `music.envelope`, not only `music.volume`.
- Adding any music track halves everything (see the 6 dB note in the SKILL).
  Normalise after every render that has music.

## Loudness targets

Platforms re-normalise on upload and can pump artefacts doing it, so a render
far from about **-14 LUFS** is a defect even though it plays fine locally.
Local synthesis is conservative, so renders trend quiet by default. Normalising
stream-copies the video, so it is fast and lossless picture-side — there is no
reason to skip it.

Confirm both duration and loudness with a probe after the final render. Every
shipped-broken audio mix in this pipeline's history would have been caught by
one measurement.
