description: Use when a finished cut has to leave the pipeline and continue in a human editor — exporting a timeline to Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro or CapCut, or answering what survives the trip and what an editor has to rebuild.

# Edit Handoff

"Can I finish this in Premiere?" is a handoff, not a render. The job is to move
the tedious half of the edit — forty cuts on their true frames, each clip
pointing at its real source, audio in sync — and to be exact about the half that
does not move, because being vague there costs an editor an afternoon.

## Requires

`pip install 'video-studio-engine[export] @ https://github.com/scrollmark/social-skills/archive/refs/heads/master.tar.gz'`
covers all three exporters (`export_fcpxml`, `export_capcut`, `export_edit`); only
`export_edit` needs the `[export]` bracket, for OpenTimelineIO. None is bundled —
each reads the engine's timeline document and composer directory. No install, no
export. What survives is the judgement below, which applies to any OTIO or FCPXML
handoff. Captions do not survive either — the composer draws them from the props —
so `video-studio burn_captions` bakes them in as pixels, or writes an `.ass`.

## Which Export, Which Application

| Target | Script | Route |
|---|---|---|
| Premiere Pro, DaVinci Resolve | `video-studio export_edit` | `.otio`, imported natively — no plugin |
| Final Cut Pro | `video-studio export_fcpxml` | `.fcpxml` 1.9, opens as a real project |
| CapCut | `video-studio export_capcut --install` | overwrites `draft_info.json` in an existing project |
| Any of them, another machine | add `--bundle` | copies the media in beside the timeline |

    video-studio export_edit --project <dir>

**Always pass `--project`.** It rebuilds that project's timeline first. The
composer's props document is global, so exporting unbuilt silently emits
whichever video was rendered last — a wrong file that looks entirely correct.

There is no `.prproj` writer and there should not be one: Premiere's format is
undocumented, versioned to the application, and a reverse-engineered writer
breaks silently inside someone else's edit. Adobe's supported inbound paths are
OTIO, FCP7 XML, AAF and EDL. FCPXML is the opposite case — Apple publishes it,
which is why Final Cut gets a direct writer.

## What Travels

**Survives everywhere:** every cut at its true frame, each clip linked to its
real source file, per-scene narration, music, and the captions as a sidecar
`.srt` (Premiere imports it as a caption track).

**Does not survive the generic path:** camera moves, fades, and the on-screen
cards. This is not a gap in the exporter — the interchange formats carry no
effects at all; OTIO's own matrix marks effects unsupported across EDL, FCP7
XML, FCP X and AAF alike. So cards are written as **timeline markers carrying
their text** at the frame where each appeared, and camera moves are marked the
same way. The editor does not get the title; they get a labelled spot saying
what belonged there.

**Final Cut is the exception worth naming.** `export_fcpxml` writes cards as
real `<title>` elements on Final Cut's Basic Title generator and camera moves as
keyframed `<adjust-transform>`, both editable in the inspector. Measured on a
real project, the generic OTIO→FCPX adapter emitted zero of each. If the cards
matter and the editor is on Final Cut, use this path.

## CapCut Wants an Empty Project First

Ask the user to create one in CapCut itself (File > New Project, save, add
nothing) and hand over the path. The script will not create the folder. A real
project carries a dozen undocumented sibling files — `draft_meta_info.json`,
`draft_settings`, `Resources/`, `matting/` — that only CapCut knows how to
write, and a folder missing them appears in the drafts list and does nothing
when clicked. Cards do not travel here either.

## Anti-patterns

- **Exporting without `--project`.** The failure is silent and ships the wrong video.
- **Saying "it exports the whole video".** It exports the cut. Effects are rebuilt.
- **Promising cards on the OTIO path.** They arrive as markers. Only FCPXML carries them.
- **Claiming app-tested.** The FCPXML is validated by parsing its own output, not by
  opening it in Final Cut. Say which one you mean.
